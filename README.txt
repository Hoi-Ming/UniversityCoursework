About
This game was created for the City Uni Java module on the Information Systems course in my 1st year, 2011/12.

Dist Installation
Make sure you clone all "dist" files in the "NetBeansProjects" into the same directory. Then run IN1007.jar!
The game will silently fail if image and lib files are not in the same directory. Will fix this bug soon!

Space - Shoot
Up - Jump
